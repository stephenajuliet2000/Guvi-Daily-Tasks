Objects And Its Internal Representation In JavaScript

               Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building
               blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s 
               primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) 

               objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data,
               of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be 
               variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.  

Objects and properties
               A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a 
               variable that is attached to the object.

               =>  objectName.propertyName

               Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property 
               name are case sensitive. You can define a property by assigning it a value. For example, let’s create
               an object named myCar and give it properties named make, model, and year as follows:

               => var myCar = new Object();
                  myCar.make = 'Ford';
                  myCar.model = 'Mustang';
                  myCar.year = 1969;

Creating Objects In JavaScript :

                One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and 
                values inside curly braces as shown below   

                => let bike = {name: 'hero honda', maker:'bajaj', engine:'937cc'};   

Using the JavaScript Keyword new

                The following example also creates a new JavaScript object with four properties:

                Example

                      var person = new Object();
                      person.firstName = “Stephena”;
                      person.lastName = “Juliet”;
                      person.age = 23;
                      person.eyeColor = “black”;
